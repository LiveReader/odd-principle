ODD (Ontology & Data Driven) Principle is the ontology metamodel for building applications based on these methodologies.  
The [Ontology](https://odd-principle.org/odd-principle.owl) along with the [documentation](https://odd-principle.org) is published at [odd-principle.org](https://odd-principle.org).

It builds on three pillar concepts:

### Dictionary

A dictionary to define and describe the symbols used in the ontology.

### Business Process

A business process approach to gain flexibility and agility from the ODD-principle.

### Expert Knowledge

A methodology to capture and share expert knowledge in a structured way.
